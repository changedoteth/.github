# Changeth

Changeth is a system that combines zero-knowledge cryptography with Sybil-resistance systems to enable petitions that are verifiably signed by humans, without exposing any private information. We are currently developing our Proof of Concept to demonstrate these capabilities, and are seeking grant funding.

## Long-term roadmap
- Allow easy integration of any sybil-resistance provider, starting with Gitcoing Passport and World ID
- Run a real petition/vote gated to only World ID or Passport holder
- Cooperate with schools in Czechia to allow students to verify using their Student Identity Cards and vote on proposals for their institution.
